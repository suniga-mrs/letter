                        <p><h5>To my Micah,</h5></p>
                        <p>I feel weird writing this. We've known each other for years and here I am putting all I wanted to say to you in a webpage.</p>
                        <p>Believe me, I want tell this in person yet whenever I try, my mind's always twenty words ahead of what I was going to say first. So I end up not saying anything at all and forgetting everything</p>
                        <p>
                            <h6>Today had been tough and we both know that's a total understatement.</h6>
                        </p>
                        <p>Life changing - is what I would describe it (for better or for worse).</p>
                        <p>You're unexpectedly expecting a child - a life about to be born.</p>
                        <p>I held your hand and keep saying "It's okay" (or something like that), YET who am I kidding? Life is already tough and it's gonna be tougher ahead.</p>
                        <p><h6>Despite of it, there's one thing I'm sure. Things might not get better, but we'll be stronger.</h6></p>
                        <p>You might not see it yet, but you are strong. Strong enough to go through this.</p>
                        <p>And it's okay if you don't feel strong enough. We'll get strength from God.</p>
                        <p><blockquote><em>He gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless. (Isaiah 40:29)</blockquote></em></p>
                        <p><h6>I will be here for you.</h6></p>
                        <p>I am limited and I get scared too, but I'm comitted to help you and be there for you.</p>
                        <p>Even if I don't know half (or whole) of the things of what you're about to go through, I'll support you. I'll help you consider all the options you have. I'd love to go with you to your doctor's appointment, go with you shopping for everything you'll need.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes I'm slow to understand things, but I'd like to study and learn stuff about pregnancy together so I can help you better.</p>
                        <p>And when I get overbearing or crowding you too much, tell me. I'll give you the space you need.</p>
                        <p>But please don't isolate yourself.</p>
                        <p><h6>You're not alone.</h6></p>
                        <p>You might feel lost in everything that's going on. You might think that your life is ending as a new life about to start (that's not true by the way). You might think that no one cares.</p>
                        <p>Know this: <blockquote><em>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost. (Luke 19:10)</blockquote></em></p>
                        <p><h6>We have hope in Jesus.</h6></p>
                        <p>You might not remember this, but it's a memory I've held onto.</p>
                        <p>Back in high school, there's time that a pastor came to our school for our quarterly church service. They preached to us about Jesus.</p>
                        <p>I remember as most of our classmates (including you) and schoolmates stood up to answer and surrender to Jesus. Most probably did it out of not feeling left out. Maybe you did too.</p>
                        <p>In my heart I believed in that simple act. Whether we knew it or not, I knew it's effect is for a lifetime.</p>
                        <p><h6>I still believed that Jesus is already in your heart. He loves you unconditionally.</h6></p>
                        <p><blockquote><em>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:38-39)</blockquote></em></p>
                        <p>As Jesus has saved me from my mess ups, anger, bitterness, unforgiveness and rebelliousness, so He would to you. As He filled the void in me and gave me purpose, He will do the same for you. As He provided all that I need, so He will to you</p>
                        <p>He changed my life for the better. It's not perfect yet, but it's a hundred times better than before.</p>
                        <p>Walk with God is not easy, but it's worth it</p>
                        <p>I want to share all this to you. I want to walk with God and see you walk with Him too.</p>
                        <p><h6>Against the reality we're facing now, I believe in the future He's promising us, and I hope you'll believe in it too.</h6></p>
